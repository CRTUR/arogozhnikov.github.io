Hello.

My name is Alex Rogozhnikov (Алексей Михайлович Рогожников), and 'brilliantly wrong' is my personal blog.

I have PhD in mathematics and physics from [Moscow University](http://www.msu.ru/en/).

I have some other degrees as well :)

* master degree in Math &amp; CS from Computer Science faculty of MSU
* master degree from [faculty of mathematics](http://math.hse.ru) of Higher School of Economics (definitely great place if you want to devote your life to math) 
* degree from [Yandex School of Data Analyst](http://yandexdataschool.ru), 
  which is one of the best places (or simply best place?) to study programming, data analysis and machine learning.   


Currently I'm working at [Yandex](http://yandex.ru), involved in [CERN](http://cern.ch) projects. 
Area of my interest is development of Machine Learning methods (mostly, somehow applied to fundamental sciences, though not limited by those). 

If you're interested in things I am doing, take a look at
 
* [gradient boosted reweighter](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/hep_ml/blob/master/notebooks/DemoReweighting.ipynb)
* [uniform gradient boosting](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/hep_ml/blob/master/notebooks/BoostingToUniformity.ipynb) 
* visualization of optimal control of oscillations (to be published soon) 

Also sometimes I participate in educational projects of Yandex Data School. 
Take a look at MLHEP 2015 [slides]({% post_url 2015-09-07-mlhep-slides %}) and [repository](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2015).
