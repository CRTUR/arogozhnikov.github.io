A small post about different tricks I use in numpy. Since frequently I work with statistical data and different statistical criterions, frequently I have to compute the order statistics (alternatively, one can ask about which position will get every number in array after array was sorted) <br />There is  <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.rankdata.html">rankdata</a>function inside scipy which solves the named problem: <br /><pre style="background-color: #2b2b2b; color: #a9b7c6; font-family: 'Menlo'; font-size: 12pt;">result = rankdata(array)</pre>However, one can easily implement this is numpy (isn't beautiful?): <br /><pre style="background-color: #2b2b2b; color: #a9b7c6; font-family: 'Menlo'; font-size: 12pt;">result = numpy.argsort(numpy.argsort(array))</pre>which is (almost) equivalent code. <br />See also my previous post on <a href="http://brilliantlywrong.blogspot.com/2015/05/numpy-tricks-again.html"> numpy tricks</a><br />PS. Once upon a time I will understand why all blogging platforms suggest heavy and ugly layout templates. Even adding background image turns into non-trivial task.
