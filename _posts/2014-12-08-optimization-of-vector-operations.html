<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Recently worked over optimization of&nbsp;some (secret) classifier. The problem was mostly not in&nbsp;training, but in&nbsp;applying of&nbsp;trained classifier&nbsp;— this code was originally written in&nbsp;C++ and then translated to&nbsp;cython (which decreased the speed by&nbsp;factor of&nbsp;2).<br /><br />This was quite easy rewrite the code using numpy and vectorized approach (initally predictions were built event-by event, after rewriting the classifier was applied tree-by-tree). However this gave only speed comparable with original&nbsp;C++ code (so, twixe faster cython).<br /><br />What really fastened the code is&nbsp;switching from int8 operations to&nbsp;int64 (the latest are natively supported in&nbsp;all modern processors). So&nbsp;8&nbsp;operations in&nbsp;int8 were grouped into one&nbsp;<nobr>64-bit.</nobr>&nbsp;This is&nbsp;done pretty simple by&nbsp;creating views:<br /><br /><pre>In[1]: import numpy<br />In[2]: x = numpy.random.randint(0, 100, size=64000).astype(’int8′)<br />In[3]: y = numpy.random.randint(0, 100, size=64000).astype(’int8′)<br />In[4]: %timeit x&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;y <br />10000&nbsp;loops, best of&nbsp;3: 60.6 µs per loop<br />In[5]: %timeit x.view(’int64′) &amp;&nbsp;y.view(’int64′) <br />100000&nbsp;loops, best of&nbsp;3: 12 µs per loop<br /># Checked that output is&nbsp;correct<br />In[6]: numpy.all( (x&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;y) == (x.view(’int64′) &amp;&nbsp;y.view(’int64’)).view(’int8′) )<br />Out[6]: True<br /><br /> </pre><div><br />In&nbsp;this simple example we&nbsp;see 5x&nbsp;speed&nbsp;up. Views of&nbsp;course do&nbsp;not copy the data, which is&nbsp;very essential for the speed. This trick can be&nbsp;applied with: summation&nbsp;/ subtration&nbsp;/ binary or&nbsp;/ binary and, but you need that the size of&nbsp;original array was divisible by&nbsp;8.<br /><br />By the way, there is awesome collection of&nbsp;<a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html" target="_blank">twiddling bit</a><u>s</u>, which was my starting point in bit optimizations.</div></div>
