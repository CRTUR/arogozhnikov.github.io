<p><a href="http://libfm.org/">LibFM</a>&nbsp;<span>is library for factorization machines using an</span>&nbsp;<span>approach proposed by</span>&nbsp;<span>Steffen Rendle. However it</span>&nbsp;<span>seems that there is</span>&nbsp;<span>no</span>&nbsp;<span>python wrapper for this famous library.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if</span>&nbsp;<span>you’re looking for python version of</span>&nbsp;<span>it, take a</span>&nbsp;<span>look at</span>&nbsp;<span>these projects:</span></p>

 Lovely minimalistic implementation of&nbsp;Factorization Machines using cython (previous version used numpy).<br/>
 This library has an&nbsp;interface similar to&nbsp;scikit-learn. 
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://ibayer.github.io/fastFM/index.html">http://ibayer.github.io/fastFM/index.html</a><br/>
 fastFM&nbsp;is another option. Library supports both classification and regression.<br/>
 Contains three different solvers (SGD, ALS, MCMC). ALS = alternative least squares.<br/>
 In&nbsp;the paper written by&nbsp;author of&nbsp;algorithm, he&nbsp;argues that other algorithms are comparable to&nbsp;SGD.<br/>
		<br/>
 This library is&nbsp;completely following scikit-learn interface (even deriving from BaseEstimator and appropriate mixin classes). 
	</li>
	<li>I&nbsp;was also looking for code in&nbsp;theano, but the only code&nbsp;I found was very dirty and minimalistic (so&nbsp;I’m not hoping it&nbsp;is&nbsp;usable)<br/>
