I was always sure that optics is the most important moment to have nice photos in darkness. But today's smartphones have cameras with very small objective, and nevertheless produce better pictures then my Lumix TZ5.<br />The latter has an objective which is at least 10 times larger in area, but this doesn't help.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.iphonefaq.org/images/archives/iphone-5-black-camera-assembly.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.iphonefaq.org/images/archives/iphone-5-black-camera-assembly.jpg" height="238" width="320" /></a><a href="http://www.cameralabs.com/reviews/Panasonic_Lumix_DMC_TZ5_TZ15/images/PanTZ5k_main.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.cameralabs.com/reviews/Panasonic_Lumix_DMC_TZ5_TZ15/images/PanTZ5k_main.jpg" height="227" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Machine learning reconstruction of image? Good stabilization? Miracle? Or simply I'm doing something wrong with my old lumix?
