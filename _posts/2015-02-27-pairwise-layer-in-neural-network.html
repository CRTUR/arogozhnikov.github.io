<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">In <a href="http://brilliantlywrong.blogspot.ru/2015/01/neural-networks.html">one</a> of previous posts I said that pairwise layer doesn't seem to work...<br /><br />Well, I was wrong: after checking on higgs-boson dataset from kaggle I found out that this kind of neural network works much better than traditional ones! Hurrah!<br /><br />Though, much worse then GBDT, but after building AdaBoost over neural network I was able to get comparable (or just the same) quality. The only problem is GBDT trained in minutes, while it took ~24 hours for boosting over NN to train.<br /><br /><br /></div>
